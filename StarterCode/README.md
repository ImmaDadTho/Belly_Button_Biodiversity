# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## In this Activity I take data from a study on the microbial species located in the belly button.

#### This is an Interactive dashobard that displays and explores the `Belly Button Biodiversity dataset`

This dataset reveals  a handful of microbial species that were present in more than 70% of people. I created
two visualizations a `Bar Chart` and a `Bubble Chart` to display some of the data in the datset. I also 
created a dropdown that lets you choose which individuals data you want to explore and when choosing the individual
you will see all the datas value key pair.

## The Bar chart
In the bar chart visualizations I created it horizonally and made it display the top 10 OTU's found in
that specific individual. 

## The Bubble Chart 
In the bubble chart visualizations I created it with the Veridas Color scale and  made it display each 
sample.

The bar and Bubble chart are displaying from the current individuals samples chosen from the dropdown 
menu and the visualization refresh after choosing a different individual.
